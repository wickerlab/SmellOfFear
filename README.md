# From What You See to What We Smell: Linking Human Emotions to Bio-markers in Breath

Research has shown that the composition of breath can differ based on the human’s behavioral patterns and mental and
physical states immediately before being collected. These breath-collection techniques have also been extended to observe the
general processes occurring in groups of humans and can link them to what those groups are collectively experiencing. In this
research, we applied machine learning techniques to the breath data collected from cinema audiences. These techniques included
XGBOOST Regression, Hierarchical Clustering, and Item Basket analyses created using the Apriori algorithm. They were conducted to
find associations between the biomarkers in the crowd’s breath and the movie’s audio-visual stimuli and thematic events. This analysis
enabled us to directly link what the group was experiencing and their biological response to that experience. We first extracted visual
and auditory features from a movie to achieve this. We compared it to the biomarkers in the crowd’s breath using regression and
pattern mining techniques. Our results supported the theory that a crowd’s collective experience directly correlates to the biomarkers in
the crowd’s breath. Consequently, these findings suggest that visual and auditory experiences have predictable effects on the human
body that can be monitored without requiring expensive or invasive neuroimaging techniques.
